_- 👋 Hi, I’m @WoSchiller
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in intersections between data science and the humanities at large, as well as with archeology, my 'academic' specialization in particular.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning very basic programming and adjacencies.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on path-dependent, hopefully rapidly changing subjects, as such rapid change would imply progress.
- 
- 📫 How to reach me: in whatever way you prefer.
