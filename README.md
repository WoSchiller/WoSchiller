_- Hi, I’m @WoSchiller
- 
- I’m interested in intersections between data science and humanities, particularly archaeology.
- 
- I’m looking to collaborate on path-dependent, hopefully rapidly changing subjects, as such rapid change would imply progress.
- 
- Reach out to me in whatever way you prefer.
